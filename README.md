# alexanderkehr.de

## Actual Version

Replaced my well-thought-through profile page with a sarcastic, unrelevant piece of art.

[See it live!](https://www.alexanderkehr.de/)

## Older Version (tag v1.0)

Templates and content for my personal static (no scripts, plain html) website.

Using the power of **SVG** and **CSS**.

Made of [mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) and [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss), deployed by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
